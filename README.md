# Brandon Doey - Personal Portfolio

## 🚀 About The Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. Built with modern web technologies, it serves as a centralized hub to showcase my professional experience, technical skills, and deep dives into Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

The site is designed to be fully responsive, aesthetically minimal, and highly interactive, featuring custom animations and a "bento-grid" style layout for project showcases.

### ✨ Key Features

  * **Interactive UI:** Custom Framer Motion animations, including a "spotlight" hover effect on project and skill cards.
  * **Data Science Integration:** Direct hosting and rendering of Jupyter Notebooks covering topics like LLMs, Financial Literacy AI, and Anomaly Detection.
  * **Responsive Design:** Fully adapted for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using Tailwind CSS.
  * **Performance:** Powered by Vite for lightning-fast builds and optimized asset loading.

## 🛠️ Built With

  * **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - Frontend framework
  * **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Type safety and logic
  * **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first styling
  * **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)** - Animation library
  * **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** - Build tool and development server

## 📊 Data Science & AI Projects

A unique feature of this portfolio is the inclusion of detailed Jupyter Notebooks located in the `/notebooks` directory. These projects demonstrate practical applications of Machine Learning and AI:

  * **AI Financial Literacy (Local LLM):** Exploring local Large Language Models for financial education.
  * **Llama3 Anomaly Detection:** Leveraging Llama3 for identifying anomalies in datasets.
  * **Bankruptcy Prediction:** Using Ensemble methods to predict financial distress.
  * **Stock Prediction (LSTM):** Time-series forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory networks.
  * **Sentiment Analysis (LDA):** Topic modeling and sentiment extraction.
